A book index is a key to locating information contained in a book. Readers can make use of the indexes to do research and/or analysis about a book. In this project, our task was to develop a program using ArrayList (ListIndex),  TreeMap (MapIndex), and HashMap (HashIndex) to extract the index of different books with different sizes. The goal was to compare the performance of these data structures and conclude which data structure is better for this application. As part of the requirement, the words that we process in this project are the english words. Hence, we used an English dictionary.   For this project, our hypothesis is that using an ArrayList will be the slowest while using a TreeSet would be the fastest. Our assumption is that to process data with an arrayList a shifting always occurs when a new word is added. It takes time. On the other hand, a hashmap needs to be sorted before the data is written in an output file. Sorting is also time consuming.
